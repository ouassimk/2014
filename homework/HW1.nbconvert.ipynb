    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework we ask you three questions that we expect you to answer using data. For each question we ask you to complete a series of tasks that should help guide you through the data analysis. Complete these tasks and then write a short (100 words or less) answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We will briefly discuss this homework assignment on Thursday in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "For this assignment we will use two databases: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) which contains the \"complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2013, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more. For more details on the latest release, please [read the documentation](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2012.txt).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org) is a great resource that contains over [500 data sets](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) related to world indicators such as income, GDP and life expectancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn how to: \n",
    "\n",
    "a. Load in CSV files from the web. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. Create functions in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "C. Create plots and summary statistics for exploratory data analysis such as histograms, boxplots and scatter plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful libraries for this assignment \n",
    "\n",
    "* [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/index.html), for arrays\n",
    "* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), for data frames\n",
    "* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), for plotting\n",
